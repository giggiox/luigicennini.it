# graphTheory-Visualizer

Project made to visualize operations that can be done in a graph, such as BFS,DFS,Kruskal and Dijkstra.\
The goal was to have a continuous display of the various operations, so that if the graph changes while the operation is in progress, the display changes too.

You can access it here (works best on desktop): https://giggiox.github.io/graphTheory-Visualizer/  <br/><br/>
