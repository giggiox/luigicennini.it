Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing  subsequence.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
